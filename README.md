# Energy Consumption Forecasting using Machine Learning

Predicting household energy consumption using various machine learning models and identifying the best-performing model.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting energy consumption based on historical power consumption data. Different machine learning models were compared to find the most accurate and reliable predictor.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
